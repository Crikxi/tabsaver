# Tab Saver

WebExtension to manage your tabs.
With this extension you can save tabs in current window and open them later.

[Install from addons.mozilla.org](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/vyrtsev-tab-saver/)

### Caveats

Current state of Firefox WebExtension Api restricts opening of privileged urls (such as `file:///`, `chrome:`, `about:`, etc..) so placeholder page will be opened where you can copy link to clipboard and manually paste it into the location bar. Sad.
